What firewalls are for.
They monitor and filter incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization's previously established security policies.

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
HTTPS is a more advanced and secure version of the HTTP protocol. It includes SSL, which is a part of the HTTPS protocol that performs encryption of the data. SSL certificate - authenticates the websiteâ€™s identity and establishes a secured channel for communication between the website and the client.

What monitoring is used for.
Tracking the health, metrics, and performance of your web servers, so you can ensure high-level functioning.

How the monitoring tool is collecting data.
Web servers are monitored for user load, security and speed. Application servers are monitored for server availability and responsiveness. Storage servers are monitored for availability, capacity, delay and data loss.

Terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue.
The traffic between the load-balancer and the server is unencrypted and, therefore, is vulnerable to data theft, session hijacking, and man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks

Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue.
Some transactions committed on the master may not be available on the slave if the master fails.

Having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem.
Your web site and database will share the same server resources (disk usage, memory, CPU). As a result, your database and web site will run slower than they would if they did not share resources with each other.
